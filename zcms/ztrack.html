    <h1>ZTrack: JavaScript-Based Click Tracker</h1>

    <p>This is just a basic script I wrote that tracks were your
    users click (relative to a specific element, usually your &lt;body&gt;).
    What for? SEO! If you see your users clicking on an image that's not
    a link, maybe you should make it a link. If you see your users not clicking
    on a link enough, maybe you should try moving it closer to the top;
    and after you do so, you can see the difference in click-rate.</p>


    <p>For example, click on the images below; then click on the
    "View Clicks" button to see where other users (and you) had have
    clicked the most.</p>
    
    <div><img src="ztrack.png" alt=""></div>

    <p>Press the button to see users' clicks: <button>Press me gently</button></p>
